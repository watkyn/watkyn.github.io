There is a lot of angst among developers of the iPhone/iPad community over <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/iphone_agreement_bans_flash_compiler">the language restrictions of the new iOS 4.0 license</a>, and rightfully so.  Mobile Orchard closed shop because of it and there may be more high profile developers leaving the Apple platform in the future.<br /><br />There is one positive for the Objective-C developers, though.  The scarcity of their skill set will most likely continue.  Objective-C developers have experienced a renaissance in their once obscure language and frameworks, but now they are the chosen ones and they get paid like it.  Scarcity will give them the advantage in the market, driving up their rates/salaries as long as Apple continues to dominate in the arena of sales.<br /><br />This may be the only positive that comes from Apple's decision, and it is only a positive for a minority of developers, so in the end ... blech.
