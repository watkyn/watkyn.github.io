Well, I don't have much to say about the Refactoring: Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional (which is what I decided to look at this week on Monday).  Sounds great!  Change it if it makes sense.<br /><br />Like Fowler says in the book, "The most difficult part of this refactoring is checking that I can do it."<br /><br />If the change will not cause too many ripple effects, it can be done very nicely.  Otherwise, you may be facing a big ball of mud and it may not be feasible.
