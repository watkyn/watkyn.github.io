I have been hearing about the pomodoro technique and so I started trying it for myself.  I really like the concept, and often times, I need some help staying focused and not getting distracted.  However, when I am tuned in to my code and really focused on what I am doing, I can go for hours at a very high level.  This happened to me lately as I was working on an iPhone project.  I knew what I wanted to get done, and trying to use pomodoro was just getting in the way.<br /><br />When you are in "flow" from a programmer's perspective, then go with the flow and skip the pomodoro.  I don't want any breaks, especially breaks in my concentration at that point.
