    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Exactly one year ago today <a href="http://www.watkyn.com/blog/2010/04/08/Mind-Share-Part-One/">I posted about &ldquo;mind share&rdquo;</a> and how I was going to &ldquo;punch out&rdquo; of the tech world and enter fully into my home life with my full attention.  Well, it has gone pretty well.  There is definitely a correlation between programming too much and mind share issues.  The biggest lesson I&rsquo;ve learned is to recognize when I&rsquo;ve been pushing too hard, and deliberately let go of the things I don&rsquo;t have time for.<br /><br />Here are a few thoughts about what has worked for me and what has not in my ever elusive quest for work life balance.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Things that worked:</span><br /><ul><li>Early mornings:<br />I have been reading and working on projects by getting up really early in the morning.  Working early in the morning has several benefits for me.  1) It is a natural time box that I can&rsquo;t easily lengthen since I need to get ready for work eventually.  2) My mind is fresh and doesn&rsquo;t feel tired like it can later in the evening.  3) I&rsquo;m not taking away from time with anybody else (they are all still sleeping).<br /></li></ul><ul><li>Family projects:<br />My wife and I worked on a project together.  It is a website that helps her keep track of things she buys in bulk to better understand which of those things are making her money and which are not worth the investment. This was fun because it was something we could work on in the evening but it wasn&rsquo;t taking time away from us being together.  It also was different than when I worked on a project by myself because now we were both thinking about the same thing, so if I had an idea for Homestore Lane (<a href="http://homestorelane.com/"><a href="http://homestorelane.com">http://homestorelane.com</a></a>) it was something we could talk about, unlike if it was some project she was not interested in.<br /></li></ul><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Things that didn&rsquo;t work so well:</span><br /><ul><li> One night per week to work on projects:<br />There are several reasons I don&rsquo;t think this worked very well for me.  1)  I was already mentally tired by the time I started on my projects.  2) It was hard to unwind and go to sleep after programming late into the night.  3) It was hard to get back into things after waiting for the whole week (or sometimes longer since it was easy to skip a week).</li></ul><ul><li>Trying harder to compartmentalize:<br />It wasn&rsquo;t mind over matter for me.  I had to stop trying to do so much before I noticed the difference in my attention span and my engagement in my home life.  Even though I would tell myself to stop thinking about projects, my brain just could not unwind enough because it was too tired (or engaged, or ?).<br /></li></ul><br />I&rsquo;m going to stick with the morning thing and maybe some more family projects and see how it goes.  If there is anything else along these lines I am sure I will blog about them next year.  Or the year after, maybe.  (I am already staying up too late to write this, so what am I doing?  Time to stop.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After reading <a href="http://praglife.typepad.com/pragmatic_life/2009/05/punch-out-log-off-.html">the pragmatic life post called Punch Out  Log Off</a>,   I began thinking about a term I call &ldquo;mind share&rdquo;.  Think of mind share in terms of twitter, but instead of asking &ldquo;what are you doing right now&rdquo;, you ask, &ldquo;what are you thinking about right now?&rdquo; If you ask yourself this question periodically, you will begin to see some patterns.<br /><br />For example, let&rsquo;s say you are spending some quality time with the family.  What are you thinking about?  Do any of the answers to the mind share question sound like the list below?  If so, the people around you are not getting quality time from you and believe me, they can tell:<br /><br />&ndash; &ldquo;What is the killer feature for idea X that I should build?&rdquo;<br />&ndash; &ldquo;I wish my company used REST web services instead of SOAP?&rdquo;<br />&ndash; &ldquo;I should tweet that I am hanging out with the fam right now.&rdquo;<br />&ndash; &ldquo;Someone is talking to me, and I am looking at them, but I have no idea what they just said.&rdquo;<br />&ndash; &ldquo;What a cool idea for an iPhone App. I better write it down.&rdquo;<br />&ndash; &ldquo;I think I just heard my iPhone buzz.  Was it email, SMS, ebay, Fring, or one of the 700 other possibilities?&rdquo;<br /><br />It takes a conscious effort to make sure the people in the room with you are given more priority than the virtual world we work and play in throughout the day.  I have been analyzing this in my own life for the past couple years (mostly the negative effects) and have started to understand some of the ways that I can give more mind share to the people I love and compartmentalize my work better.<br /><br />In part two of this post, I might try to explain some of the things I have been learning that help keep my mind from getting too absorbed in tech. Actually, I may never write part two, if I am successful at punching out and checking in to life at home better.</p>
